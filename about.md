Hello & Welcome to Almanack.
<br><br>
Our goal is to tell the rich narrative of the modern American life. Join us as we explore what it means to be American in both heritage and horizon.
<br><br>
While focused on current events and the experience of today, we draw upon the stories that have shaped the nation from its inception. From the agrarian societies of its infancy and revolutionary spirit of its youth, through the forge of the Civil War and the taming of Wild Wild West, beneath the smokestacks of the Industrial Revolution and the opulence of the Gilded Age, into the trenches of the World Wars and the surge of the Great Society, the atomic vigor of the mid-20th century that carried us into space and the technological advancements that have defined its most recent history, Almanack Magazine aims to capture our modern times and the ongoing saga of a nation continually reinventing itself yet always striving to uphold its founding ideals.
<br><br>
Our magazine speaks to those who appreciate the complexities and the contributions of Americana, and who seek insights that are both retrospective and forward-looking in our coverage of arts, culture, business, politics, science, sports, and more. Our audience is the mature, thoughtful individual who cherishes the lessons of history and the historical paths we've traveled, yearns for the new - yet eternal - stories that are being created in the present, and pursues the American spirit long into the future by remaining always connected to the enduring threads of American values and dreams.
